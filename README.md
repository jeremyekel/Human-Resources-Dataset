# Human-Resources-Dataset
University group project

The project is based on a Kaggle competition ''https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set'' where it has been taken into account a dataset in .csv (HRDataset_v13.csv) which revolves around a fictitious company, called Dental Magic, for which is given data such as names, DOBs, age, gender, marital status, date of hire, reasons for termination, department, whether they are active or terminated, position title, pay rate, manager name, and performance score.

These information, that will be explained in detail later, are used for determining a series of characteristics of the company. In particular, it is in our interest to answer a series of questions asked by the owner of the dataset: Dr. Rich Huebner.

The open-question for the project are:

1. Is there any relationship between who a person works for and their performance score?
2. What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?
3. What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?
4. Can we predict who is going to terminate and who isn't? What level of accuracy can we achieve on this?
5. Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?
